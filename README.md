What is Lean?
-------------
Rooted in Purpose, Process and respect for People, Lean is about creating the most value for the customer while minimising resources, time, energy and effort.

The Definition of Lean
----------------------
A Lean approach to work is about understanding what's really going on at the gemba (the place where value is created), improving the processes by which products are created and delivered and empowering people through problem solving and coaching. Lean thinking and practice helps organisations become both innovative and competitive, which in turns allows them to become more sustainable.

Today Lean has become a new, more effective approach to doing and organising work. It is a superior business system. In a Lean organisation problems are opportunities for meaningful learning rather than errors to be swept under the carpet. Managers act as coaches, helping others get comfortable identifying problems and practicing daily continuous improvement. Leadership means creating a management system to support a new kind of engagement with the real work at hand, the way the work is being done now, not the way you and your team hope to be doing work sometime in the future.

Lean recommends that managers and executives embarked on lean transformations think about three fundamental business issues that should guide the transformation of the entire organization:

- *Purpose:* What customer problems will the enterprise solve to achieve its own purpose of prospering?
- *Process:* How will the organization assess each major value stream to make sure each step is valuable, capable, available, adequate, flexible, and that all the steps are linked by flow, pull, and leveling?
- *People:* How can the organization ensure that every important process has someone responsible for continually evaluating that value stream in terms of business purpose and lean process? How can everyone touching the value stream be actively engaged in operating it correctly and continually improving it?

> "Just as a carpenter needs a vision of what to build in order to get the full benefit of a hammer, Lean Thinkers need a vision before picking up our lean tools," said Womack. "Thinking deeply about purpose, process, people is the key to doing this."

# The Scrum Team

The Scrum Team consists of a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master. Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. Cross-functional teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team. The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity.

Scrum Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback. Incremental deliveries of “Done” product ensure a potentially useful version of working product is always available.

### The Product Owner

The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Development Team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.

The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog. Product Backlog management includes:

*   Clearly expressing Product Backlog items;
*   Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;
*   Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs;
*   Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next; and,
*   Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.

The Product Owner may do the above work, or have the Development Team do it. However, the Product Owner remains accountable.

The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, but those wanting to change a Product Backlog item’s priority must address the Product Owner.

For the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions. The Product Owner’s decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog. No one is allowed to tell the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements, and the Development Team isn’t allowed to act on what anyone else says.

### The Development Team

The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.

Development Teams are structured and empowered by the organization to organize and manage their own work. The resulting synergy optimizes the Development Team’s overall efficiency and effectiveness.

Development Teams have the following characteristics:

*   They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;
*   Development Teams are cross-functional, with all of the skills as a team necessary to create a product Increment;
*   Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members other than Developer, regardless of the work being performed by the person; there are no exceptions to this rule;
*   Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team, regardless of particular domains that need to be addressed like testing or business analysis; there are no exceptions to this rule; and,
*   Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole.

### Development Team Size

Optimal Development Team size is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint. Fewer than three Development Team members decrease interaction and results in smaller productivity gains. Smaller Development Teams may encounter skill constraints during the Sprint, causing the Development Team to be unable to deliver a potentially releasable Increment. Having more than nine members requires too much coordination. Large Development Teams generate too much complexity for an empirical process to manage. The Product Owner and Scrum Master roles are not included in this count unless they are also executing the work of the Sprint Backlog.

### The Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted. Scrum Masters do this by ensuring that the Scrum Team adheres to Scrum theory, practices, and rules.

The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team. The Scrum Master helps those outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team are helpful and which aren’t. The Scrum Master helps everyone change these interactions to maximize the value created by the Scrum Team.

#### Scrum Master Service to the Product Owner

The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including:

*   Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management;

*   Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;

*   Understanding product planning in an empirical environment;

*   Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value;

*   Understanding and practicing agility; and,

*   Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.

#### Scrum Master Service to the Development Team

The Scrum Master serves the Development Team in several ways, including:

*   Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality;

*   Helping the Development Team to create high-value products;

*   Removing impediments to the Development Team’s progress;

*   Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed; and,

*   Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood.

#### Scrum Master Service to the Organization

The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:

*   Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption;

*   Planning Scrum implementations within the organization;

*   Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development;

*   Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team; and,

*   Working with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum in the organization.

### The Sprint

The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or **less** ***(recommended 1-2 weeks)*** during which a “Done”, useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created. Sprints best have consistent durations throughout a development effort. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

Sprints contain and consist of the Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, the development work, the Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective.

During the Sprint:

*   No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;

*   Quality goals do not decrease;

### Sprint Planning

The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.

Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose. The Scrum Master teaches the Scrum Team to keep it within the time-box.

Sprint Planning answers the following:

*   What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?

*   How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

## Topic One: What can be done this Sprint?

The Development Team works to forecast the functionality that will be developed during the Sprint. The Product Owner discusses the objective that the Sprint should achieve and the Product Backlog items that, if completed in the Sprint, would achieve the Sprint Goal. The entire Scrum Team collaborates on understanding the work of the Sprint.

## Topic Two: how will the chosen work get done?

The Development Team usually starts by designing the system and the work needed to convert the Product Backlog into a working product Increment. Work may be of varying size, or estimated effort. However, enough work is planned during Sprint Planning for the Development Team to forecast what it believes it can do in the upcoming Sprint. Work planned for the first days of the Sprint by the Development Team is decomposed by the end of this meeting, often to units of one day or less. The Development Team self-organizes to undertake the work in the Sprint Backlog, both during Sprint Planning and as needed throughout the Sprint.

By the end of the Sprint Planning, the Development Team should be able to explain to the Product Owner and Scrum Master how it intends to work as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment.

### Daily Scrum

The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. This is done by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting the work that could be done before the next one. The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity. During the meeting, the Development Team members explain:

*   What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?

*   What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?

*   Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?

*   The Scrum Master ensures that the Development Team has the meeting, but the Development Team is responsible for conducting the  
Daily Scrum. 

*   The Scrum Master teaches the Development Team to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15-minute time-box.

*   The Scrum Master enforces the rule that only Development Team members participate in the Daily Scrum.

Daily Scrums improve communications, eliminate other meetings, identify impediments to development for removal, highlight and promote quick decision-making, and improve the Development Team’s level of knowledge. This is a key inspect and adapt meeting.
